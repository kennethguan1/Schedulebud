 ## Challenges

* React library components were used to create the calendar. As these were a third party tool, it was difficult to manipulate the components and understand the props passed to them for the components to function as I wanted it to.

## Future Implementations

* Currently, the calendar styling is styled minimally to focus on functionality. Will need to improve the CSS / styling of the calendar along with its inner components to improve the calendar's design.

* Would like to add a feature to add work orders, locations, and technicians manually onto the calendar rather than just via csv files.
